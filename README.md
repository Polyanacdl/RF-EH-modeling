# Supplementary code for "Behavioral Modeling of an Energy Harvesting Circuit in RF Wireless Power Transfer Systems for Batteryless Iot Applications"
This repository provides the MATLAB codes used in the thesis "Behavioral Modeling of an Energy Harvesting Circuit in RF Wireless Power Transfer Systems for Batteryless IoT Applications", authored by Polyana C. de Lacerda (2025).
The scripts implement and validate the behavioral modeling of RF energy harvesting (RF-EH) circuits and their integration into wireless power transfer (WPT) systems for batteryless IoT applications.

Description
The repository includes the step-by-step implementation of models and simulations presented in the thesis.
The codes cover:
Modeling of RF-to-DC conversion using nonlinear logistic functions.
Experimental validation with measurement data for different reference voltages.
Simulation of charging (EH phase) and discharging (TX phase) processes in energy-harvesting circuits.
Comparative analysis with state-of-art model from the literature.
Evaluation of recharging cycles under BLE, LoRaWAN, and 6TiSCH communication protocols.
Each script is self-contained and annotated to facilitate reproducibility of the results presented in the thesis.
